# Research Guide

I'm listing here a series of guidelines for research that I've been using for years. It might be useful to take a look here before you do any of the following research activities:

1. [Start research](start.md)

2. [Read a paper](reading.md)

3. Write a paper or dissertation

    [How to write the Methodology section](meth.md)

    [How to write a Discussion](discussion.md)
    
    [Hints for a Good Abstract](abstract.md)
    
    [Introduction, what is required](intro.md)
    
    [Threats to Validity](threats.md)

    [Ways to Improve](waysToImprove.md)

4. [Present your research](presenting.md)

5. [Write your dissertation/thesis](thesis.md)

6. [Search for a place to submit papers](submission.md)

7. [Prepare a replication package](replication.md)

8. [Doing qualitative research](qualitative.md)
