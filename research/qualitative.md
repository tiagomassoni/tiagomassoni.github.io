title: Qualitative Research
---

We conduct qualitative research because a problem or issue needs to be *explored*, when we need to study a group or population, identify variables that cannot be easily measured or hear silenced voices. Also, we conduct qualitative research when a complex, detailed understanding of an issue is needed. 

We use qualitative research to follow up quantitative research and help explain the mechanisms or linkages in causal theories or models. These theories provide a general picture of trends, associations, and relationships, but they do not tell us about the processes that people experience, why they responded as they did, the context in which they responded, and their deeper thoughts and behaviors that governed their responses.
