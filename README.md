## Research

### Human Factors in Software Development

- I've been working on Diversity for Software Development Teams. Camila Sarmento finished her Ph.D., focusing on how women deal with community smells and challenges in the context of agile estimation meetings. Collaboration with [Alexander Serebrenik](https://www.tue.nl/en/research/researchers/alexander-serebrenik), [Gemma Catolino](https://www.gemmacatolino.com/), [Damian Tamburri](https://research.tue.nl/en/persons/damian-a-tamburri), and [Fabio Palomba](https://fpalomba.github.io/)./
  [Paper at SBES]()/
  [Paper at SANER](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9825896)/

- Team leadership styles in Agile teams is currently being researched by Ph.D. student Narallynne Maciel, in collaboration with Prof. [Lucas Gren]()./
  Papers at SBES [2023](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3555228.3555263) and [2024]()/

- My former Ph.D. Ruan Pierre pursued research on people abandoning the software development profession./

### Software evolution and refactoring

- Flávia Estélia has finished her Ph.D. on investigating whether code reviewers induce actual refactorings in repositories. Collaboration with Prof. Everton Alves and Prof. Tsantalis./
  [Paper at ESEM](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3475716.3475785)/

- In 2024, Marcelo Vitorino finished his M.Sc. dissertation on the relationship with code smells detected by code reviewers. Collaboration with Prof. João Brunet.

### Bug reports

- In collaboration with Prof. Fraklin Ramalho, working on using machine learning can help investigate the relationship between bug reports and the actual bug management process/

### Computer Science and Public Health

- In collaboration with group of medical doctors, I have been exploration the application of LLMs (Large Language Models) for image diagnostics, within the UFCG Medical school and Hospital ([HUAC](https://www.gov.br/ebserh/pt-br/hospitais-universitarios/regiao-nordeste/huac-ufcg))

- In collaboration with researchers from Brazil, United Kingdom and Turkey, I actively engaged in a multidisciplinary research project [Project MEWAR](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/risk-disaster-reduction/research-projects/2024/may/mosquito-population-modelling-early-warning-system-and-rapid-health) to model mosquito populations for early warning systems and rapid response public by health authorities correlating climate, weather and spatial-temporal mobile surveillance data, helping fight vector-bourne diseases, such as Dengue and Zika.
